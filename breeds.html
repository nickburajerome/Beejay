However, there are primarily three types of pisciculture. They are - Monoculture, Polyculture and Monosex Culture. 


To define pisciculture, first, you need to know its variants in detail. Let’s begin! 


Types of Pisciculture
There are mainly three types of pisciculture and different available. These are:

Monoculture – This system allows farming a single species of fish. It offers high production and quality. These fishes are popular among consumers. Usually, in India, an example of monoculture fish is shrimp. 

Polyculture – It is also called composite or mixed fish farming. Polyculture lets rearing different species of compatible fishes in a shared pond. However, their feeding habits have to be different so that each of the species can survive on different food from a common resource. It is a beneficial kind of pisciculture. 

Monosex Culture – Generally, this culture allows growing either female or male fishes of a species. This is how fishes are obtained through this culture. One example of such fish is Tilapia. .</p>
